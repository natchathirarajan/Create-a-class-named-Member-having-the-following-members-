    private String address;
    private double salary;
    public Member(String name, int age, String phoneNumber, String address,
                  double salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
        this.address = address;
        this.salary = salary;
    }
    public void printSalary() {
        System.out.println("Salary :" + salary);
    }
}

public class Employee extends Member {
    private String specialization;
    public Employee(String name, int age, String phoneNumber,
                    String address, double salary, String specialization) {
        super(name, age, phoneNumber, address, salary);
        this.specialization = specialization;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee employee = new Employee("John", 25, "9856452634", "T.Nagar",
                25000, "IT");
        Manager manager = new Manager("Arjun", 30, "8425631579", "Anna Nagar",
                80000, "AI&ML");

        //Employee Salary
        employee.printSalary();
